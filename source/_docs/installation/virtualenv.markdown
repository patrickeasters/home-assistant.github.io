If you already have Python 3.5 or later installed, you can easily give Home Assistant a spin.

It's recommended when installing Python packages that you use a virtual environment. This will make sure that your Python installation and Home Assistant installation won't impact one another.

_(If you're on a Debian based system, you will need to install Python virtual environment support using `apt-get install python3-pip python3-venv`.)_

 1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```
    $ python3 -m venv homeassistant
    ```
 2. Open virtual environment:
    ```
    $ cd homeassistant
    ```
 3. Activate virtual environment:
    ```
    $ source bin/activate
    ```
 4. Install Home Assistant:
    ```
    $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade homeassistant
    ```
 5. Run Home Assistant:
    ```
    $ hass --open-ui
    ```
