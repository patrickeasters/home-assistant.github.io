The Home Assistant Cloud allows you to quickly integrate your local Home Assistant with various cloud services. Any processing of services from other cloud services is handled by your local Home Assistant.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry to enable the cloud component
cloud:
```

Once activated, go to the configuration panel in Home Assistant and create an account and log in. There is no need to configure your router or expose your instance to the internet in any other way.

### {% linkable_title Amazon Alexa %}

The Alexa integration allows users to control the entities via the [Home Assistant Smart Home skill for Alexa][alexa skill]. This means that you can say things like "Alexa, turn on the kitchen light" to control your local instance.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry configuring Alexa
cloud:
  alexa:
    filter:
      include_entities:
        - light.kitchen
      include_domains:
        - switch
      exclude_entities:
        - light.living_room
      exclude_domains:
        - script
```

{% configuration %}
alexa:

  required: false
  type: map

          required: false
          type: list
        include_domains:
          description: Domains to include.
          required: false
          type: list
        exclude_entities:

          required: false
          type: list
        exclude_domains:
          description: Domains to exclude.
          required: false
          type: list
{% endconfiguration %}
