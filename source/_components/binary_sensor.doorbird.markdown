The `doorbird` binary sensor platform allows Home Assistant to monitor when your [DoorBird](http://www.doorbird.com/) doorbell rings.

<p class='note'>
  You must have the [DoorBird component](/components/doorbird/) configured to use this binary sensor.
</p>

To enable the binary sensor, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: doorbird
```
